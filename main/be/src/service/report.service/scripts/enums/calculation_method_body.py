    CENTRALIZED = "Our company utilizes the 'Centralized' method for GHG emissions data calculations. This approach involves a centralized system or team responsible for systematically collecting and processing emissions data from various sources across our organization. By standardizing data collection and calculation methodologies, we ensure accuracy and consistency in our emissions reporting. This centralized approach also enables us to efficiently manage and analyze emissions data, supporting comprehensive environmental assessments."
    DECENTRALIZED = "Our company employs the 'Decentralized' method for GHG emissions data calculations. In this approach, responsibility for collecting and processing emissions data is distributed across various departments or units within our organization. Each unit manages its emissions data independently, following established protocols. While this approach allows for a more granular view of emissions at the departmental or facility level, it requires coordination and data consolidation efforts to ensure accuracy and completeness in our overall emissions reporting."
